# Usage

mp3-to-mp4 is built with the intention of converting folders of tagged audio files to mp4 rapidly.

### Conversion:

To convert an entire folder:

```
mp3-to-mp4 convert /c/my_folder/
```

Converting a single file and specific (optional) image:

```
mp3-to-mp4 convert /c/my_folder/my_music.mp3 --image /c/other_folder/image.jpg
```

**NOTE**: If your path includes parentheses, you may need to place it in single quotes to avoid bash errors. e.g. '/c/my path (with mp3s)'

### Image Selection:

Image paths can be specified with the `--image` flag.

A background image path can be specified with the `--bg-image` flag.

If no image is specified, mp3-to-mp4 will try to grab the image from the file's metadata.

If no image is present in the metadata, it will search the folder for a suitable image and use the first one it finds.

At the moment, mp3-to-mp4 considers .png and .jpeg/.jpg files that match the following as suitable images.

`folder, album_art, albumart, art`

If there is no image available, text will be generated based on the `artist` and `title` ID3 tags, unless a join command has been given, where the `album artist` and `album title` tags will be used.

### Configuration Flags:

Flags available under the `config` command.
