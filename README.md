# Usage

mp3-to-mp4 is built with the intention of converting folders of tagged audio files to mp4 rapidly.

To convert an entire folder:
```
poetry run mp3-to-mp4 convert /c/my_folder/
```
It will default to using a specified image, failing that the file's ID3 image tag will be used.

If there is no image available, text will be generated based on the `artist` and `title` ID3 tags.

Other uses:

Converting a single file and image:
```
poetry run mp3-to-mp4 convert /c/my_folder/my_music.mp3 --image /c/other_folder/image.jpg
```
